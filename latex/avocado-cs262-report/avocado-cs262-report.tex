% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors

\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present \texttt{avocado}, a distributed variant caller built on top of ADAM and Spark. \texttt{avocado}'s goal is to provide
both high performance and high accuracy in an open source variant calling framework. To achieve this, we implement both local assembly
and pileup-based single nucleotide polymorphism~(SNP) calling. A key innovation presented in our work involves the development of
heuristics for when to choose more expensive assembly-based methods instead of pileup-based methods. Additionally, we introduce the
concept of ``significant statistics,'' a tool for performing incremental joint variant calling.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Modern genomics processing pipelines can be divided into four primary ordered stages:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Sequencing:} Gathering of read data from DNA
\item \textbf{Alignment:} Alignment of read data against reference genome
\item \textbf{Variant Calling:} Statistical determination of differences against reference genome
\item \textbf{Variant Annotation:} Annotation of impact of variation
\end{enumerate}

Currently, to run a genomics pipeline end-to-end for a single high coverage genome\footnote{High coverage refers to having on average
$>$30$\times$ bases aligned to each location in the reference genome.} consumes approximately 100 hours~\cite{talwalkar13}. Of this
100 hour figure, both alignment and variant calling consume approximately 50 hours each.

Although some applications that use genomic data are latency insensitive~(for example, population genomics), many medical applications
like genomic medicine, or genomic classification of viral outbreaks~\cite{snitkin12} are latency sensitive. However, it is unacceptable to
sacrifice accuracy in the pursuit of speed. Recent work has focused on the problem of accelerating alignment~\cite{zaharia11}; in this paper,
we address accelerating variant calling.

As noted above, it is unacceptable to sacrifice accuracy for performance. To achieve improved performance, we implement several
enhancements:

\begin{itemize}
\item Current pipelines are penalized by I/O performance, we address this by using an in-memory MapReduce framework~\cite{zaharia10}
to reduce I/O pressure
\item Additionally, we leverage the new ADAM data format~\cite{massie13}, a high performance file format for distributed genomics
\item Finally, we achieve high accuracy at a low performance cost by using high fidelity assembly-based methods only on complex
segments of the genome
\end{itemize}

In this paper, we discuss this system, related work, and perform a performance analysis. We start with a discussion of the related work
in~\S\ref{sec:related-work}. We then describe our architecture and algorithms in~\S\ref{sec:architecture}. Finally, we analyze the performance
of our system in~\S\ref{sec:evaluation}, and propose future research directions in~\S\ref{sec:future-work}.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related-work}

There has been significant work related to variant calling, and towards accelerating the genomic processing pipeline. In this section, we
discuss other variant calling pipelines, and tools that we use in our evaluation.

\subsection{ADAM}
\label{sec:adam}

% Frank 0.33pg

ADAM~\cite{massie13} is a new data format for genomics meant to replace the Sequence/Binary Alignment/Map~(SAM/BAM) formats for read
data~\cite{li09}, and the Variant Call Format~(VCF) for variant/genotype data~\cite{danecek11}. The original SAM/BAM/VCF formats were
designed for single-node processing, and do not easily distribute across several machines. Although a library was designed for processing
BAM/VCF data in Hadoop~\cite{niemenmaa12}, this API does not scale well past 8 nodes. ADAM achieves scalability beyond 100 machines
by eliminating the central file header, and by using the Parquet data store which is optimized for parallel data access~\cite{parquet}.

In the process of developing \texttt{avocado}, we contributed 2,500 lines of code~(LOC) to the ADAM project. This contribution comprised
the variant and genotype format, code for calculating normalized variant data from genotypes, and converters to/from the VCF format.
